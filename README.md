# Stacki

Stacki is a stack-based interpreter that borrows all opcodes from [Whitespace](http://compsoc.dur.ac.uk/whitespace). It is not another assembler for Whitespace, but it has an analogous syntax to that of it; each opcode and operand can be directly translated into a corresponding one of Whitespace.
